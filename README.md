## Feature requests and bug reports
This project is open to new ideas - If you think the app could do with a certain feature or want to report a bug, please
* Read through or search the existing [list of issues](https://github.com/vinaygopinath/launch-chat/issues)
  * If you have additional context (screenshots, scenario) to share that is not already reported in the issue thread, add a comment. If there is no additional context to share but you'd like to highlight that you'd like to see the feature/bug issue addressed, please use the üëç reaction on the issue.
* If your idea has not already been suggested, please create a [new issue](https://github.com/vinaygopinath/launch-chat/issues/new), using the "Do something" format ("Add option to create a contact") for feature requests and "Something fails when I do something" format ("App crashes when I enter a Brazilian phone number and click the WhatsApp button") for failures and bug reports.

## Code
If you're a developer, you're welcome to contribute code to this project.

### Before you start working on something
* Make sure a Github issue exists for the issue you're interested in addressing (new feature, fixing a bug). Pull requests submitted without an associated GitHub issue will be considered unsolicited, and your efforts may go unused!
* Leave a comment in the issue thread to indicate that you're interested in working on the issue. This ensures that there is no duplication of effort across contributors.
* If you're new to Android development or would like to pair on an issue, I might be available at times. Please reach out via Mastodon or Signal DM, accessible through my GitHub profile, specifying the GitHub issue you're interested in and the specific part(s) and acceptance criteria you'd like to pair on.

### During development
* Commit often - Prefer small commits that address one problem, even if it's only a few lines, versus a large commit that does a lot. This ensures that commits are readable and reviews are faster.
* Uphold code quality - Ensure that code changes are readable, performant and properly tested.

### After development
* Open a pull request targeting the `main` branch of this project, including a succinct PR title, a summary of changes in the PR description, a link to the GitHub issue that the PR addresses, steps to test and any additional documentation (links to reference articles/websites, screenshots and/or screencasts) that might be relevant to reviewers.
* Be open to a review cycle - Reviewers may seek additional clarifications or flag their concerns. Address comments and push changes to your branch.
